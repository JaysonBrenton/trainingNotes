## Local Project Setup

The officially recommended tool for creating react projects is [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). To create a react app,

1. Install create-react-app,
```
>npm i -g create-react-app
```
2. Run create-react-app,
```
>cd <your_project_base_dir>
>create-react-app my-first-react-app
```
3. Start the app,
```
>cd my-first-react-app
>npm start
```
